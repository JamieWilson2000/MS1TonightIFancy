            <div class="u-list">
            <ul>
                <li> 1 1/2 pounds boneless center cut pork loin cut into 1/4-inch thick slabs, then 1/4-inch thick strips, about 3 inches long</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon canola or peanut oil plus extra if necessary</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic peeled and minced or pressed through a garlic press</li>
                <li>2- inch knob of fresh ginger grated</li>
                <li>1/2 cup mild honey</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup sriracha or chili garlic sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar or white wine vinegar</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="o-list">
                <ol>
                    <li>In a liquid measuring cup or a small mixing bowl, whisk together the mild honey, sriracha, and rice wine vinegar. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium high heat and swirl to coat. Let it heat until it is shimmering. While the oil heats, sprinkle the pork strips with kosher salt and black pepper then toss with your hands to distribute it evenly. Carefully add the pork to the pan, working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Let the first side brown, flip the pieces with tongs or a spatula, and brown the second side. Transfer the pork to a plate. </li>
                    <li>Return the pan to the heat and add in the garlic and ginger. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Raise the heat to high and pour in the sauce mixture and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. When the sauce is very bubbly and thickened like warm honey, toss the pork back in and toss constantly to coat everything and reduce the sauce to a thick, sticky glaze on the pork. This can be served immediately over rice, noodles, or as finger food, or can be allowed to cool and be eaten cold.</li>
                </ol>
